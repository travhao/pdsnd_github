# Bikeshare Final Project

### Description
This code is meant to provide an interactive way to analyze basic ride share metrics
on datasets for either Chicago, New York City or Washington DC.  The user enters 
information on the city that they'd like to review and the program asks a few questions
to understand what type of data the user would like to return. Some highlights are shown below:  

- Users are able to show 5 data records at a time if they would like
- Metrics returned include the following:
  - Most common month, day of week and hour of ride shares
  - Most commonly used start, stop and start/stop station combinations
  - User stats of user type, gender
  - Year of birth stats (earliest year, most recent year, and most common year)

### Files used
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv
